jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the directory of the notebook you want to run. Open it and execute the cells to see the output.

## Notebooks Overview

### Classification

1. **Logistic Regression**: This notebook explains logistic regression and its application in binary classification. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics.

2. **Random Forest Classification**: Explore the random forest algorithm, its advantages, and how to implement it using Scikit-learn. The notebook covers feature importance and model accuracy.

### Regression

1. **Linear Regression**: Learn the basics of linear regression. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building a linear regression model, visualizing results, and understanding residuals.

2. **Polynomial Regression**: Discover how polynomial regression can fit non-linear data. The notebook includes techniques for transforming features and model evaluation.

### Clustering

1. **K-Means Clustering**: Understand the K-means algorithm, its implementation, and how to choose the right number of clusters. This notebook includes visualizations of cluster assignments.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Explore hierarchical clustering methods and dendrogram visualizations. The notebook discusses how to interpret clusters and the significance of linkage methods.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. **EDA on Iris Dataset**: This notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the Iris dataset. It includes visualizations, correlation matrices, and insights drawn from the data.

2. **EDA on Titanic Dataset**: Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand survival rates and the factors influencing them. The notebook features various visualizations and statistical analyses.
